Sampling Strategies
==============

These notebooks are intended to study the effect of sampling strategies on 
learning samples in order to determine how good a training strategy is.

###Hypothesis
> If I sample my data with a set of known models, each of it more useless, the
further my learning is from the sampling model, the better my learning.

# Usage
```
ipython notebook --pylab inline
```

Goals I seek with this repo
===========================

This work is nothing but the perfect excuse to migrate from matlab to python. And test all the things I want to incorporate in my research such as:
* sphinx, for a continuous documentation
* get back to design my code (UML and firends) `instad of just smashing the keyboard as thoughts cross my mind`
* unit testing
* coding style


In other words, just get closer to *open-science* and facilitate results *repeatability*
